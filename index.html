      <h2>About Me</h2>
          
        <p>
          As I became older I realised I had to plan for when I was over 50 and unemployable. So I began my first journey, which was designing and engaging developers in building a website, <a href="https://www.lizandez.com.au/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        ><strong>www.lizandez.com.au</strong></a> I began selling <a href="https://www.lizandez.com.au/collections/all"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        ><strong>leather bags</strong></a> and moved to the high quality end of this market. I faced many challenges both financial and practical ones. I must say I invested a lot of money and time, but I learned a lot and made some really big mistakes. We upgraded and built new websites along the way, until we got to the best one yet. My wife joined me and after over 9 years we are still loving what we are doing and it’s our passion. We are really now looking to find a reputable manufacturer so we can begin our next phase of our business which is making and designing Lizandez branded leather bags. This drive and passion we had enabled us to create a beautiful website, I got so much enjoyment from planning, designing and implementing functionality that would accommodate my customer requirements, SEO and more. This passion, drive and enjoyment is one of the major reasons I wanted to be a a Full Stack Web Developer.
          </p>
<p> During and after undertaking the website builds and as the Lizandez business developed and grow, I was employed in the Transport Warehouse & Logistics industry playing many roles from Management to planning and development of new warehousing facilities and fixing up broken systems and warehousing. I also did a lot with WMS systems and even assisted in completely writing one software package from scratch, from a design and process perspective. I am sorry this industry has gone down hill fast and unfortunately, as the overall logistics industry has deteriorated over the years I have lost my enthusiasm. I had never been so unhappy and miserable working in this industry. I was pretty fed up and just wanted to work somewhere I had a love and passion for in my job again, something I thought I would never find. Of course besides my own business, but I wanted to do something that would also compliment my business. The learning opportunities of becoming a full stack (Software Engineer) web developer had become available and demand is high. I have always loved new technologies and have begun my journey doing a fully supported boot camp course. I have found my passion again and can’t wait to learn enough to building and creating websites and hopefully create some amazing applications, Apps and sites. I am just loving playing with sorting problems out with websites and learning code is so exciting. I now look forward to the new challenges I have in front me. I am hoping I can find a full time role as a Full Stack Web Developer. My Curriculum encompasses the following competencies, programs and subject matter. HTML, Git, CSS, Sinatra, JavaScript, SQL, Rail React & Rack, Object Orientation API interactions, Database modelling & MVC, SASS & Application deployment and more.
</p>
<p>The other driving force is the people I have met and worked with, having that support and giving support creates positive outcomes in people and myself. The communities and the team environments are really great to be a part of and hope to meet lots of great people.
